Linux kernel baseline requirements
==================================

At the minimum, a Linux kernel with working SYS_futex system call is needed. The
first public release with that syscall was 2.6.0, which makes that version the
baseline for all architectures. However, further features may be required per
architecture:

1. The 2038 problem
-------------------

On 32-bit architectures, the kernel historically set time_t to be a signed
32-bit type. In January 2038, 2^31 seconds will have passed since 1970, making
the time stamp overflow from 2038 back to 1902 if saved in a signed 32 bit
number.

Linux has recognized the peril and added system calls that deal in 64-bit time
units even on the 32-bit archs. But they were a bit late to do so, and only
added these in Linux 5.12.

I do not want to create an environment now that will seem to work just fine and
fall over in 13 years. Therefore, I require these 64-bit time syscalls to be
present even today, and will not fall back to the 32-bit methods.

x32 is (as usual) a special case since it has always supported 64-bit time
syscalls through the usual methods, despite being a 32-bit arch.

2. Arch/ABI support
-------------------

For the remaining architectures:

x86_64 support was already present in 2.6.0.
x32 support was added in 3.4.
aarch64 support was added in 3.7.

PPC64 support was already present, but I require the ELFv2 ABI. Supporting both
ELFv1 and v2 would be some effort that I'm not sure is worth it. The only point
to supporting ELFv1 at this point is compatibility with existing binaries, and
no binaries for sirius exist. But ELFv2 requires kernel support, which was added
in 3.13.

Conclusion
----------

These are the baseline requirements per arch:


aarch64:        3.7
i386:           5.12
powerpc:        5.12
powerpc64:      3.13
x32:            3.4
x86_64:         2.6.0
