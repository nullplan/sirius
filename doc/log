Calculation of the log
======================

1st: Argument reduction

x = 2^k (1+f) where √2/2 < 1+f < √2

Method of reduction:
k = exponent(x)
exponent(x) = 0
if (x > sqrt(2))
    x /= 2, k++
f = x - 1.0

if (f == 0) return k ln 2;
if (|f| < 2^20) {
    R = f² * (1/2 - 1/3 f)
    return k ln 2 + f - R;
}

2nd: Approximation of the log on 1+f:

We use s = f/(2+f), therefore
s (2+f) = f
2s + sf = f
2s = f - sf
2s = (1 - s)f
f = 2s/(1 - s)
1+f = (1+s)/(1-s)
   
and therefore log(1+f) = log(1+s) - log(1-s). That function has the Taylor series:
f(s) := 2s + 2/3 s³ + 2/5 s⁵ + 2/7 s⁷ + ... (and yes, the pattern holds. Always 2/n x^n for all the odd numbers n).

and it is computed to the 15th degree.

3rd: Finally log(x) = k ln 2 + log(1+f)

Special cases: log(±0) = -∞ with underflow. log(x < 0) = NaN with invalid. log(∞) = ∞, log(NaN) = NaN.
