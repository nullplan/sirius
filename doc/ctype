The character sets
==================

Design goal: Locale independence of ctype, support UTF-8
Restrictions: Must support POSIX locale.

In POSIX locale: MB_CUR_MAX = 1, mbtowc() never returns EILSEQ.

What does this all mean, taken together? It means that I want a UTF-8 locale and
a POSIX locale. Since in UTF-8 mode, isalpha(x) must return 0 for high bytes,
the only possible choice of charset for the POSIX locale is ASCII (because that
is the only 1-byte charset I know that also says the same).

And while mbtowc() must not return EILSEQ in POSIX locale, nobody said the
conversion had to be an identity conversion. Since isalpha(x) returns 0 for high
bytes, in POSIX locale, high bytes must be converted to such wide characters
that iswalpha(x) also returns 0. Thankfully, due to UTF-16 there is a large
block of characters cut out from Unicode where all the functions returns 0.

That block is the surrogate characters, which range from D000 to DFFF. Idea
would be to convert each high byte to a surrogate, so the conversion is
bijective.

Character classes
=================


ALL
|- control
|  |- control whitespace
|  `- other control
`- printing
   |- printing whitespace
   `- graphing
      |- alpha
      |  |- lower
      |  |- upper
      |  `- other alpha
      |- punct
      `- digit

iswalnum    : alpha+digit
iswalpha    : alpha = Unicode category L
iswblank    : ' ' + '\t'    (seems to be the consensus)
iswcntrl    : control   = 0000..001F, 007F..009F, 2028, 2029
iswdigit    : '0'-'9' (POSIX definition)
iswgraph    : graphing = all printing characters that have a non-empty rune
iswlower    : lower = all characters that have a case fold to upper case
iswprint    : printing = all Unicode characters that aren't control
iswpunct    : punct = all printing that isn't alpha or digit
iswspace    : control whitespace + printing whitespace  = Unicode property "White_space" = 0009..000D, 0020, 0085, 00A0, 1680, 2000..200A, 2028, 2029, 202F, 205F, 3000
iswupper    : upper = all characters that have a case fold to lower case
iswxdigit   : '0'-'9', 'A'-'F', 'a'-'f' (POSIX definition)

I need a list of
    - alphabetic characters. Raw in alpha.txt.
    - printing characters. Raw in printable.txt
    - space (but that is a small list; I just use the musl list).

as well as a list for the case map (Raw in casefold.txt).

Executive decision: I use the standard blank set, which musl also does. The
definition is that blank characters are those whitespace characters used to
separate words in a line, and that concept doesn't mean a whole lot in cultures
that don't use the ASCII space.

I also use the space list from musl, since it and the glibc list are basically
the same. And I use the control list from musl, since it makes more sense to me
than the glibc one. But I use my own "printable" list, since Unicode does have
holes. Printable is all defined Unicode characters that aren't control
characters or surrogates.
